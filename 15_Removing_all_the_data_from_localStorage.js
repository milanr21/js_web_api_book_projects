// Discussion
// Browsers limit the amount of data that you can store in Web Storage.
// Typically, the limit is about 5 MB. To avoid running out of space and
// throwing an error, you should remove items once they are no longer needed.
// Depending on what youâ€™re using Web Storage for, you can also provide a
// way for your users to clear stored data. Consider an emoji picker that stores
// recently selected emojis in local storage. You might add a Clear Recents
// button that removes these items
